A text-to-video web application

After installing the codes, create a file called .env. The name is only .env, nothing else. No .env.py or example.env. Just .env

The info in the .env file should be the following (No need to add info in the parathesis):

REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=Your REPLICATE_API_Key (Get the API key here, https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-schnell/api)
OPENAI_API_KEY= Your ChatGPT API key (Get the API key here, https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
MAX_WORKERS=4
VIDEO_QUALITY=high


After installing the necessary libraries in the codes, run server.py and open the link in the console where you can press the create button on the website. 
Then, choose your image style and caption style and wait for about 10 minutes to get a well done ai generated video
